# Auto Accept Agent

*Disclaimer: This extension is paid. Lesser alternatives are available with less functionality and may not work with newer versions of Antigravity/Cursor*

## The only Auto Accept that works. Achieve more in less time.

Agent nagging at you for terminal commands when you literally turned on allow all?
Browser agent stuck at "waiting for approval"?

No more monitoring agents to approve file changes, terminal commands, browser agents ...

Auto accept them all.

## Smoothly run multiple conversations at the same time - Background mode

Auto accept agent switches tabs for you and accepts all background requests.
